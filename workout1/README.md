The purposes of this workout are to teach you how to load a nba players data frame from a csv file (nba2018.csv)and after manipulating the dataset output the selected data into an alternate csv file (nba2018-teams.csv).  The data manipulation part is to be performed in a standard r code (make-teams-table.R). Using the data saved in nba2018-teams.csv file RMD code-document is created to learn more about the verbs (arange, mutate, etc.).  Following this, ggplot package was used to create introductory charts depicting select aspects of the dataset.
